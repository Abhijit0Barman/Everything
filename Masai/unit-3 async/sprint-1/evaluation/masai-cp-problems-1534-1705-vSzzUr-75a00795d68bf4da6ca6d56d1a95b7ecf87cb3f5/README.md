## Problem statement. 1 [2 + 1]

Define a **factory function** called `CreateEmployee_1` which takes in the following parameters:

- *CreateEmployee_1* takes six input parameters 

| input parameters | type | default values |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| firstname        | string           | -              |
| lastname         | string           | -              |
| salary           | number           | -              |
| employeeStatus   | string           | terminated     |
| employeeTitle    | string           | Intern         |
| currentTasks     | array of strings | -              |


1. `firstname` (string): the firstname of the employee.
2. `lastname` (string): the lastname of the employee.
3. `salary` (number): the salary for the employee.
4. `employeeStatus` (string): the employeeStatus may be `working/terminated` default value must be **_`terminated`_**.
5. `employeeTitle` (string): employeeTitle as follow
    - a. **_`Intern`_** (Default value for employeeTitle)
    - b. Jr Software Developer
    - c. Sr Software Developer
    - d. Team Lead
6. `currentTasks` (array of strings): the task given to employee in string is present in array and using `addTask` method we are pushing new task to this array.

- If a falsey value like "" is passed to **employeeStatus** or **employeeTitle** in this case their `default` values must added to the object.

The "CreateEmployee_1" function returns an object containing the employee's details as properties, along with five methods  `fullName`,`empPromotion`, `getSalary`, `increaseSalary`, and `addTask`.

- *`fullName`* method `returns` string with text `{firstname} {lastname}`

- *`empPromotion`* is a method to `promote` the employee in case
   - if _employeeStatus_ is **terminated** `returns` string with text `employee is already terminated can't be promoted.`

   - else if _employeeStatus_ is **working** in that case employee is promoted as
      | current employeeTitle | promoted employeeTitle | 
      | :---: | :---: | 
      | Intern | Jr Software Developer |
      | Jr Software Developer | Sr Software Developer |
      | Sr Software Developer | Team Lead |
      | Team Lead | Team Lead (as it is) |
    
    - `empPromotion` should return `current title of employee is {the new employeeTitle}` **if** their employeeStatus is *working* **else** it should return `employee is already terminated can't be promoted.`

- *`getSalary`* method `returns` **salary** of employee.

- *`increaseSalary`* method `returns` **increased Salary** of employee.

- *`addTask`* method `returns` a currentTasks as
    - addTask takes in a `string` value and pushes them to the `currentTask` array. addTask **return updated currentTasks array**

    - Here currentTasks is an array when a new task is added push it to the currentTasks array .

Example invocation with expected outputs:

```
// Example invocation
let employee1 = CreateEmployee_1("Smith", "Murphy", 100, "", "Team Lead", [
  "react question",
]);

// console.log(employee1.fullName()) //Smith Murphy
// console.log(employee1.empPromotion());//employee is already terminated can't be promoted.
// console.log(employee1.getSalary());//100
// console.log(employee1.increaseSalary(100));//200
// console.log(employee1.addTask("assignment"));//[ 'react question', 'assignment' ]
```
- In above example you can notice if `employeeStatus` is just empty string we have set default value as `terminated` and because of this we can't promote the employee.

- If your input for `employeeTitle` is say "`Manager`" or "" which not belong (Intern, Jr Software Developer, Sr Software Developer,
Team Lead) in that case your default value must be `Intern`.

The purpose of this code is to provide a reusable function that creates employee objects with specific properties and methods that can be used to manipulate and get information about the employee. This function can be used to create multiple employee objects with different details based on the given parameters.

## Problem statement. 2 [2]

Define a **_constructor functions_** called `CreateEmployee_2` which takes in the following parameters:

1. `firstname` (string): the firstname of the employee.
2. `lastname` (string): the lastname of the employee.
3. `salary` (number): the salary for the employee.

The function returns an object containing the employee's details as properties, along with four methods `fullName`, `getSalary`, `increaseSalary`, and `istaxed`.

- *`fullName`* method `returns` string with text `{firstname} {lastname}`

- *`getSalary`* method `returns` **salary** of employee.

- *`increaseSalary`* method `returns` **increased Salary** of employee.

- *`istaxed`* method `returns` a Boolean value based on whether the employee's `salary` is `greater than or equal to` *800000* or not.

Example invocation with expected outputs:

```
let employee1 = new CreateEmployee_2(
  "elon",
  "mask",
  50000,
);
console.log(employee1);
console.log(employee1.fullName()); //elon mask
console.log(employee1.getSalary()); //50000
console.log(employee1.increaseSalary(500)); //50500
console.log(employee1.istaxed()); // false
```

## Problem statement. 3 [2]

Implement the functionality same as Problem 2. using `CreateEmployee_3` **_ES6 Classes_** and **_constructor_**.

Example invocation with expected outputs:

```
let employee2 = new CreateEmployee_3(
  "elon",
  "mask",
  850000,
)
console.log(employee2);
console.log(employee2.fullName()); //elon mask
console.log(employee2.getSalary()); //850000
console.log(employee2.increaseSalary(500)); //850500
console.log(employee2.istaxed()); // true
```

## Problem statement. 4 [2]

For an object with user details, you have to create a function removeKeyValuePair that takes input as 
  - user object
  - key to remove (string)

the function *removeKeyValuePair* will `return` the object without the key-value pair you have given for example we are passing `city` should get the object of a user without `city` as follows 

- you can use any method to implement but the recommended one is using the *spread operator*.[link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

- **Input**
```
const user = {
  name: "john",
  password: "john@11",
  id: "7468uwe",
  city: "New York",
}
```
- **Output**
```
// console.log(removeKeyValuePair(user, "city"));//{ name: 'john', password: 'john@11', id: '7468uwe' }
```
## Problem statement. 5 [2]

You have given a sentence with words your task is to reverse each word in the sentence
 
the function *reverseString* will `return` sentence with reverse order.

- you can use any method to implement but the recommended one is using the *split operator*.[link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-split-string-example/)

- **Input**
```
const sentence= "How are you"
```
- **Output**
```
//console.log(reverseString(sentence)); //uoy era woH
```
## Problem statement. 6 [2 + 2]

### Mapping of properties from input to expected output

- *`courseName`* maps to courseName
- *`courseDuration`* maps to Category, but the id turns into the name
- *`Category`* maps to CourseDurationDirectory, but the id turns into the name
- *`type`* maps to typeOfCourse, but the id turns into the name
- finally, 20 key-value pair techTools object & 20 key-value pair techdetails object turns into a single entry of `techTools` which is an array of object. Each object of techTools contains a key called `language` and another key called `details`.

### General guidelines

- Example inputs are just for example. The tests may check the functions by invoking them with different inputs of the same shape.
- Before writing a single line of code please read the problem statement very carefully.
- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- we also request you not just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
